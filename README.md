# ##  ML Concept SandboxAn interactive, single-page laboratory for exploring Machine Learning baselines, probabilistic mixing, and geometric stability metrics.This project takes the concept of a simple "Hello World" assignment and expands it into a visual dashboard that connects raw data statistics to advanced concepts like Chain Overlap Density and Matter Density.🚀 The JourneyThis dashboard guides you through four distinct stages of analysis, visualizing how simple randomness can be compressed into complex geometric signals:1. BaselinesCompare Random Guessing against a Majority Class baseline. Visualize convergence over hundreds of runs to understand the "floor" of model performance.2. The RouletteExplore probabilistic mixing by spinning a virtual roulette wheel. This stage simulates sampling from two hidden distributions with specific biases, visualizing the resulting entropy.3. The FingerprintCompress the results of the previous experiments into a 3D Vector $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$.Calculates the Euclidean Norm $||v||$.Projects the vector into 2D space to visualize the "signature" of the current experiment against random noise.4. Chain Overlap & Matter (Advanced)A simulation of Chain Overlap Density (a metric for training coherence).Overlap: Measures how aligned consecutive updates are.Matter: Measures the orthogonal component (noise/divergence).Reverse-with-Matter: Demonstrates how using geometric metrics can help a model "walk back" noisy updates to improve accuracy.🛠️ Tech StackCore: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) & HTML5Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for modern, responsive UI.Visuals: Chart.js (via CDN) for real-time plotting.Deployment: Zero-dependency.
